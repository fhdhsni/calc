Lessons learned (note to myself):
- A# Learn BEM, Your class names have no structure (well it's a disaster). Your styles are about to explode.
- Find a way to test on Safari.
- Test edge cases (e.g. in this case really big numbers like 22222222222222222)
- Test *performance* on the way not at the end.
